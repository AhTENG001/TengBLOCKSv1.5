When opening TengBLOCKS v1.5, you may see a warning from Windows SmartScreen warning against antivirus software. This is standard when downloading .EXE files, as Windows treats .EXE files as potentially dangerous programs.
﻿To bypass this warning safely and run TengBLOCKS, you should click "See More" and then click "Run Anyway" to run the .EXE file. If there are still warnings, you will have to do the following:
1. Right-click the downloaded file.
2.Select Properties.
3.In the General tab, look for the Security section at the bottom.
4.Check the box that says "Unblock".
5.Click OK.
Enjoy coding with TengBLOCKS v1.5! 🚀
